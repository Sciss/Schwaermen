# Folding

On the 'front'-side:

- if you fold odd indices, the two adjacent sides disappear; orientation remains
- if you fold one even index, you remove that 'crossing', instead opening two possibilities
  (up and down), where logically the remaining part is rotated 180 degrees counter-clockwise
  around the upper or lower corner
- if you fold an even index followed by an odd index, that's just the same as folding at the
  odd index
- if you fold an odd index followed by an even index, that's just the same as folding at the
  odd index

Accordingly, without further constraints here would be these possibilities for first-to-last page:

- 0
- 1
- 2
- 3
- 4
- 0, 2
- 0, 3
- 0, 4
- 1, 3
- 1, 4
- 2, 4
- 0, 2, 4

A technical constraint is two rotations, they have to be in opposite directions in order to
be able to draw a flat 2D probability distribution for the GNG. So for example, in `0, 2`, if the
first movement is to the top, the second has to be to the bottom, or vice versa. In `0, 2, 4`, 
all rotations must alternate against their predecessors (top - bottom - top, or bottom - top - bottom).

Another constraint will be the minimum and maximum fold index. For example, right column source
par could constrain that we do not have an immediately succeeding fold, left column target par
could say we do not have an immediately preceding fold.
