 # Algorithm that Connects the Video Nodes
  
 ## Definitions
 
 - {rnd} a source of random numbers, t.b.d.; possibly sensing the environment
 - there are two materials, TEXT and TRUNK
 - We assume now that TRUNK are rendered as loop and just as TEXT have indefinite duration.

 ## Initialisation
 
 - {rnd} selects either A = TEXT or B = TRUNK as initial state
 - TEXT init uses text depending on node's dot, and {rnd} to select initial word
 - TRUNK uses (eventually) a set of three videos depending on node's dot, and {rnd} to select within the set
   (we might also reduce to 3x2 videos)
 - both TEXT and TRUNK enter an "idle" state (2) which is playing the material but open for
   transition; both have a bounded duration (min, max) and choose a duration using {rnd} after
   which they take initiative (this schedule is cancelled if a successful transaction occurs before)

## Entering a Transaction

 - A3 and B3 mark the state at which either TEXT or TRUNK takes initiative. The initiative is a kind
   of dynamic 2 phase commit, and if aborted, the processes try again after a short while

## A3 TEXT takes initiative

 - picks a word that works as target, considering tx-timeout worst case
 - sends a request to all known (heart-beating) other nodes (i.e. two)
 - possible outcomes: aborted because of time-out or because of rejection (other node is busy);
   in that case we go back to idle for a while
 - or the request is successful, returning the set of possible target nodes
   (sizes 0, 1, or 2). if the set is empty, the transaction is also aborted and we go back to idle for while
 - if the set is non-empty, the requesting node picks a {rnd} target
 - transaction is thus committed or rolled-back, sending another message to all nodes
   (other nodes maintain their own time-out counter to assume the txn was aborted)
 - a successful commit equates that we are entering state (4) ejection
 - that state lasts, from the perspective of the ejecting video node, until the word(s) have
   left the screen, then it enters transition (5) to TRUNK and thus goes into state B2
   
## B3 TRUNK takes initiative

 - picks a word -- probably just the one that would have appeared after the
   previous ejection
 - sends a request to all known (heart-beating) other nodes (i.e. two)
 - possible outcomes: aborted because of time-out or because of rejection (other node is busy);
   in that case we go back to idle for a while
 - or the request is successful, returning the set of possible source nodes
   (sizes 0, 1, or 2). if the set is empty, the transaction is also aborted and we go back to idle for while
 - if the set is non-empty, the requesting node picks a {rnd} source
 - transaction is thus committed or rolled-back, sending another message to all nodes
   (other nodes maintain their own time-out counter to assume the txn was aborted)
 - a successful commit equates that we are entering state (6) injection-wait
   which is perhaps a servo mechanism that decides when to fade out the trunk
   (or we go to black straight away)
 - that state lasts, from the perspective of the injecting video node, until the word(s) have
   entered the screen (and force-layout is in 'normal' state), then it becomes TEXT and thus goes into state A2

## Receiving Request to Inject

 - in busy states A3-A5, B3-B7, the transaction is rejected
 - A2: a word is picked such that the current phase would obey the minimum duration
   (see 'Initialisation'). This includes the projected time it takes for the sound to travel
   across the network, i.e. this produces a particular path which will be either remembered
   until the txn is committed, or be part of the message sent back. It may be that the minimum
   duration cannot be satisfied, and then the response is to deny the request
 - B2: again, finds a graph traversal such that the minimum duration is obeyed.
   Either denies or succeeds with the request.
   
## Receiving Commitment to Perform the Injection Motion

 - in busy states A3-A5, B3-B7, the transaction is rejected
 - A2: this is somewhat of an "irregular mess" (we could say that TEXT should not accept any
   injection requests, but I think it's a nice asymmetry); from the animation point of view,
   we would 'pin' the word preceding the injected word when it passes the middle of the screen;
   this would probably lead to a 'stretching' of the preceding words, and they would then come
   to a halt. As soon as the actual word is injected, the 'pin' is removed again.
 - B2: entering state (6) injection-wait
   which is perhaps a servo mechanism that decides when to fade out the trunk
   (or we go to black straight away)
   
## Receiving Commitment to Perform the Ejection Motion

 - only A2 needs to respond
 - perform simply as outlined in the section 'A3 TEXT takes initiative'
